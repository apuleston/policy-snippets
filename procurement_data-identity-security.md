# Identity, data & security requirements for Education software suppliers

## Overview

As part of every procurement process where data and digital technology may be involved in the products or services being procured, we assess each supplier against some core requirements for identity, security, interoperability and access to data, as appropriate.

These requirements are designed to help us make best use of the products and services that we purchase to better serve our students, staff, and wider communities. They help reduce the impact of additional systems on staff workload.

## Identity & Access Management

**Single Sign On**: We maintain a single source of truth for identity across our trust in (Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace / Other) and we ask that, if your product or service requires that our staff or students authenticate, you allow them to do so with their (Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace / Other) account via single sign on.

**Provisioning**: Maintaining current and accurate identity data across multiple systems is challenging, particularly as the number of different systems in use grows, therefore we also ask that you provide an automated method of handling all joiners, movers, and leavers. This includes staff, students, and any other users for whom you may store data (e.g. parents).

## Data, reporting and analysis

**Connectors**: Our data is valuable to us, and we are continually expanding our capability to handle and analyse it. To give us the ability to do so, we ask that you provide us with automated access to our data that you process on our behalf. We’re open to working on 

**Termination**: We ask that, in the event that we’re not able to renew our contract or continue working with you, you commit to provide us with a full copy of our data, in a suitable export format.

## Security and deployment

### Cyber security
The safety and security of our systems is of critical importance to us. We therefore ask that suppliers provide us with a summary of the measures that they take in this area. This includes:

- Backup & disaster recovery capabilities
- Communication lines for reporting and alerting of security incidents and vulnerabilities
- Any attained standards (CE / CE+ etc…)

### Local applications

If your product or service requires the installation of software directly onto our devices, you must:

- Package your application with support for silent installation and configuration with modern MDM tools.
- Digitally sign your installers and applications.
- Configure your applications to run as a normal (non-admin) user.
- Publish any software updates in an RSS feed.
